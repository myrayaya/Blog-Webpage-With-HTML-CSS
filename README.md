# Blog-Webpage-With-HTML-CSS

### How It All Began:-

Growing up, I had a hobby of reading. It was built because of my cousin brother who would visit me and my family and would never come emptyhanded. In his hands used to be the books
which shaped my childhood. My collection was filled with literary works like 'The Great Expectations', 'Charlotte's Web', The Roald Dahl's Classic 'Matilda' and 'The Secret Garden'
among many other best-sellers. This hobby fostered another habit of reading articles and blogs. With every blog I read, I'd have gained new insights over a variety of things. 

Over the years, I had my focus on academics, having little to no time for reading. I discovered it again during Covid, when the world went on a lockdown and everything went online.
With the introduction of 'Book-Tok' and 'Book-Stagram', I fell into the rabbit hole of fictional works with many aspects to it. Around this time, I started picking up writing as
a way to express myself or retrospect. Before I knew it, I was writing fictional stories as well. However, it died down again with the growing focus over academics. 

But, writing has been a part of me since day 1. I would remember competing in different creative writing competitions and I would excel in my English exams. With less action on 
writing, I started feeling not like myself. And so, I planned to start writing again! But, where do I begin? Do I sign up for blog pages? Do I make a wordpress? I clearly had no idea
(and I probably have no idea currently either) and I wasn't confident with the drafts I made. At the same time, I wanted to start practicing HTML and CSS. 

And so, the idea struck. What if I make a practice webpage where I can create blogs as well? And, here you are now. I'm currently writing the code and the project is still in progress
but I have made the website with a lilac-ish background. I'll be adding the template and updating the code as well!
